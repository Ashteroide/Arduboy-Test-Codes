# Arduboy-Test-Codes
My Github space to test some code for C++ on the Arduboy

Game_Flow_Diagram - A simple start to basic movement and functions
Game_Flow_Diagram_2 - A remake of the first to be better constructed but still a bit similar

Digital_Clock - I was bored and made a clock that prints to the serial and screen in Seconds, Minutes and Hours
